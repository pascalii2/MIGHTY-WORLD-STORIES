  <h2>The Truth About Titanic</h2>
  <p>
    The Titanic is one of the most iconic disasters in history — but the truth goes deeper than the iceberg.
    Yes, it was the largest ship of its time, and yes, it tragically sank on April 15, 1912. But there are facts
    that often get buried beneath myths and Hollywood drama.
  </p>
  <p>
    For one, it wasn't "unsinkable." That was more a marketing spin than a fact. Engineers knew the limits.
    The real problem? Human error, overconfidence, and a lack of lifeboats. Only 20 lifeboats for over 2,000 people.
  </p>
  <p>
    And did you know there were warnings of ice ahead — ignored or delayed? The wireless operators were overwhelmed
    with personal messages from first-class passengers and missed key alerts.
  </p>
  <p>
    It’s a story of innovation, ambition, and ultimately, cautionary failure. The Titanic teaches us that no matter
    how advanced we become, nature and human decisions can still bring us down — unless we stay humble.
